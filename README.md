Reclaiming Goltarren is a turn based, party fantasy roguelike I created and spent way too long trying to finsih. 

You play a group of adventurers that have set off to reclaim the ancient city of Goltarren, which has been overrun with monsters for hundreds of years. You control a single party memeber at a time, but can switch 
at any point by hitting Tab (by default, the keys are configurable).

Your party, and monsters, can utitlize a feature called Pack Tactics, where they'll ally themselves alongside other friends and roam the dungeon grouped together. For the party, it is essiental to not get lost.
For the monsters, it can proove to make an already dangerous situation all the more deadly.

There are no set restrictions on classes. Character creation will have you pick a "class," but it's nothing more than a predefined stat block. Any character can hit with a stick, any character can cast a spell (if
they have the mana for it). 

Spells and abilities are granted through items instead of being something a character inheritly learns. Your specific loadout determines what is and isn't accessibly to a character.

Every 5 floors, a boss monster roams the dungeon halls. Similar to games like Dungeon Hack, killing them is not required to progress. They do have powerful, unique items that may be worth the risk.

Once you reach the bottom of the dungeon, you find the dragon that has made Goltarren its home. This is the only boss required to complete the level. After the dragon is defeated, you have reclaimed the ancient
city and beaten the game.

Updates:
I've experimented with only having the player control a single character, as having other characters be dumb AI was a bit frustrating. Definitely needs work, or perhaps a rule based AI system similar to 
Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, and others where this is an issue.

I also added multiplayer at one point, but the turn based nature made it a bit difficult. There are solutions for the issues I was running into, but for the moment I've opted to remove multiplayer.
